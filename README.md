## Why we made this?

Who else has ever fantasized about having a clean UI like GitHub's but on a social network ? Well we have and it's why we are building gitsocial; the ability to browse through repos styled with elegant cards.:grin:, scroll through pages smoothly, move from page to page while barely noticing the change. This is what we want to embed in gitsocial; that "GitHub feeling". We're using the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) for the data to borrow that feel.

If you have fantasized about it or like the idea, you're welcome to join us. Let us make this happen:sunglasses:
